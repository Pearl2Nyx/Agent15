# Agent15– AI Public Transport System 🚌🤖

Agent15 is a multi-modal AI agent that predicts crowding in buses and metros, delays and congestion across all transport modes, and weather-driven route disruptions for buses, taxis, and autos using behavior-based intelligence.
---

Core Idea (Unifying Principle)

---Transport stress can be inferred from how vehicles behave--

Agent15 treats buses, metros, taxis, and autos as moving sensors that reveal:


->Congestion

->Delay buildup

->Crowd accumulation

->Route disruption risks
