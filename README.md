# Pixodex – AI Public Transport Crowd Prediction System 🚌🤖

Pixodex is an AI-powered system designed to predict crowd density in public transport (with a focus on buses) across Indian cities. It helps commuters make informed travel decisions and enables transport authorities to plan capacity more efficiently.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement
Urban public transport in India frequently faces overcrowding due to peak hours, weather conditions, and local events. Commuters lack predictive information about crowd levels, leading to discomfort, safety concerns, and inefficient travel planning. Existing systems provide schedules but do not offer crowd forecasting or risk insights.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Pixodex uses machine learning to forecast bus crowd density based on historical ridership patterns, temporal trends, and contextual data. The system provides crowd-level predictions (Low / Medium / High) along with actionable insights for both commuters and transport authorities.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- Crowd density prediction for bus routes and time slots  
- Peak-hour and congestion window detection  
- Alternate travel time recommendations  
- Crowd risk indicator for safer commuting  
- Admin-level insights for route and fleet planning  

---

## 🤖 AI & ML Approach
- Time-series forecasting for passenger volume prediction  
- Pattern recognition for peak-hour analysis  
- Anomaly detection for sudden crowd surges  
- Classification models for crowd risk levels  

---

## 🧱 System Architecture (High Level)
- **User Interface / Dashboard** – displays predictions and insights  
- **Backend Services** – handles data processing and API requests  
- **ML Layer** – forecasting and anomaly detection models  
- **Data Layer** – simulated or open datasets (ridership, time, weather)
